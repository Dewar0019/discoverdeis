	{"subjects":[{"id":"1151-17","segment":"4"},{"id":"1151-15","segment":"3"}],"requirements":[],"continuity_id":"007690","name":"Java Enterprise Programming","term":"1151","id":"1151-007690","description":"Enterprise applications can be considered as an extension of Web applications. The major difference between them is that Enterprise applications usually deal with a significant  amount of business logic and significant  amount of data to persist. In addition, Enterprise applications usually don't live in isolation: they often need web services from external applications (that may be written in any language and run on any platform) and often provide web services to external applications.\n\nThis course examines how Java Enterprise technologies meet these challenges. This course will be concentrated on the following major topics and technologies that meet these challenges: Enterprise JavaBeans 3 (EJB 3) and RESTful Web Services.\n\nEnterprise JavaBeans 3 (EJB 3) are considered to be the cornerstone of the J2EE framework.  EJBs are reusable server-side Java components that encapsulate the business logic and data access of a distributed application and make it available to clients anywhere on the network.  The EJBs architecture and the runtime services they provide (high availability, transaction and session management, persistence, security) make this technology far superior with respect to other component technologies.  The Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) section of the course examines:\nâ€¢ EJB architecture and EJB containers.\nâ€¢ EntityManager as a persistence framework.\nâ€¢ Different ways of mapping persistent objects\nâ€¢ Entity relationships.\nâ€¢ Stateless Session Beans\nâ€¢ Stateful Session Beans\nâ€¢ Message-Driven Beans\n\nRESTful Web Services. REST defines a set of architectural principles by which you can design Web services that focus on a system's resources, including how resource states are addressed and transferred over HTTP by a wide range of clients written in different languages. If measured by the number of Web services that use it, REST has emerged in the last few years alone as a predominant Web service design model. In fact, REST has had such a large impact on the Web that it has mostly displaced SOAP- and WSDL-based interface design because it's a considerably simpler style to use. The RESTful Web Services section of the course examines:\nâ€¢ RESTful Web Services with JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services)\nâ€¢ Design of RESTful Web Services.\nâ€¢ Simple RESTful JAX-RS Web Service\nâ€¢ RESTful  JAX-RS HTTP Method and URI Matching\nâ€¢ RESTful  JAX-RS Injection\nâ€¢ RESTful JAX-RS Content Handlers\nâ€¢ RESTful JAX-RS  Response Codes, Complex Responses and Exception Handling\nâ€¢ RESTful JAX-RS HTTP Content Negotiation\nâ€¢ RESTful JAX-RS Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS)\nâ€¢ RESTful JAX-RS Deployment and Integration\nâ€¢ RESTful JAX-RS Security\nâ€¢ RESTful JAX-RS Java clients\n\nCourse Outcomes\nAt the end of the course, students will be able to:\n1. Design and Develop Java Enterprise  Applications using Enterprise JavaBeans 3 (EJB 3)\n2.

	{"id":"1143-012141","description":"In the past, enterprise security focused almost exclusively on the network perimeter. Enterprise security was network security: protecting the corporate network via firewalls, routers and IDS/IPS. Information lived within the confines of the corporate IT infrastructure, and attackers were focused on breaching that perimeter to gain access to information. Today, with improved perimeter security in the form of reverse proxies, stateful packet inspection firewalls, and intrusion detection and prevention system, the focus of attacks has changed. Attacks are now against software applications rather than against accessing the network per se. This is especially true with the advent of Web-based applications, but it is also true for attacks against any software that can be exploited as a stepping-stone to reach further and further inside the network. The model now is â€œinside-outâ€ rather than â€œoutside in:â€ have the user inadvertently download malicious software (â€œmalwareâ€) that then exercises vulnerabilities in other software to either 1) expose critical data, or 2) increase privileges in order to obtain a base system for further attacks. \n\nIn this course, we will focus on two critical areas of software security assessment: auditing software to determine if security vulnerabilities exist (static analysis), and then testing software to determine if additional run-time (operational) vulnerabilities exists. Auditing an application is the process of inspecting an application (either source code or binary) for vulnerabilities; in contrast, testing (whether black box or grey box) usually involves developing an attack scenario and then testing to see if the attack succeeds. \n\nThe course first will address the importance of a security development process, and demonstrate how security testing is a critical component in that process. We will focus on threat modeling techniques and patterns, and then determine how to create tests to determine that these threats have been mitigated, using a combination of case studies and lab exercises to demonstrate the effectiveness of these tests. We then will consider issues of secure deployment and secure communications once the software is delivered, and conclude with a discussion of integration of ongoing security testing within an organization's security posture. \n\nThe course is designed to support the efforts of the following individuals. \n\nSomeone who will be managing an information security department.\nSomeone leading a software development team for whom software security is a requirement.\nSomeone who is part of a QA/Test organization and needs to be aware of software security vulnerabilities and know how to develop a testing program to indicate that these vulnerabilities have been mitigated\nSomeone responsible for performing a software security assessment (internal or external).\n\nAt the end of the course, students will be able to:\nList the steps of a security development lifecycle, and the reasons why each step is critical for software security success. \nContrast software auditing with software testing, and indicate when each technique is more effective. \nDescribe common software vulnerabilities, their impact on software security, and how to develop tests to uncover these flaws. \nPerform tests to determine vulnerabilities","independent_study":false,"credits":null,"code":"RIAS 130","type":"course","subjects":[{"id":"1143-31","segment":"1"},{"segment":"4","id":"1143-15"}],"continuity_id":"012141","requirements":[],"name":"Software Security Testing and Code Assessment","term":"1143"},

Students will study the role that ideology, belief, values, and faith-based relationships can play in developing and legitimizing, or in transforming and resolving, deeply rooted conflict dynamics. The focus of this course will be on both integration of religious identity factors into conflict analysis and an introduction to faith-based interventions skills, used by religious actors to foster coexistence. During the course, we will explore different types of contemporary conflict in which religion functions as a conflict driver, including how to understand and handle conflicts perpetrated by extremist religious groups. We will also explore the diversity of faith-based reconciliation processes (such as hospitality, healing ritual, apology, etc.) as well as the kinds of roles performed by a wide variety of religious actors (education, advocacy, mediation, dialogue facilitation, etc.). Examples and case studies will be drawn from a wide variety of religious traditions and diverse cultures. In addition to those cases presented in the readings and by the professor, each student will be required to select cases on which to make a class presentation and write a paper. The purpose of these assignments, and the course in general, is to provide students the opportunity to assess concrete conflict situations in which religious identity is a factor, know the potential contribution that faith-based actors can make to coexistence, and evaluate how best to function in faith-based peacebuilding roles and reconciliation processes that interest them.

But a few centuries ago, magicians in Renaissance Europe were real people of great learning and influence. Their expansive knowledge included virtually everything:  astronomy, mathematics, geometry, music, navigation, chemistry, herbal medicine and other varied topics. They even designed airplanes, submarines, robots, and methods of telecommunication which we mistakenly believe, are the inventions of our modern times! Many of these magicians, however, also suffered due to their unquenchable desire for knowledge. Many risked their lives attempting to know things that had been forbidden by the Church of the time.  To understand these paradoxical figures, we will read the works of Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, William Shakespeare's Tempest, and Francis Bacon's New Atlantis. As we consider the representations and arguments of these magicians, we will have ample opportunity to sharpen our habits of close reading, analysis, and discussion.

The course examines architecture and design, what the important principles of SOA are, and how they should be applied. It delves into each of the important aspects of architecture, including business, information, application, and technology, as they relate to service-oriented solutions:\n\n1. Architects will learn the relationships between architectural concerns, enterprise context, and the SOA design process. This is particularly important in making architecture actionable.\n2. Designers will learn a step-by-step process for the analysis and design of services, and what the different types and styles of services are. They will come to understand what information is required from the business for complete service design, how that relates to process and information models, and how it shows up in the different design artifacts. But most importantly, they will learn how to start thinking in terms of SOA; in other words, how to shift their design paradigm.\n3.  Business analysts will learn the relationship between business strategies, goals, and objectives, and the capabilities and information that are used to achieve them. Analysts will learn how to use business process models as the link between business architecture and IT design, specifically SOA.\n4.  IT Managers will get an understanding of the SOA architecture and design process that will enable them to understand, govern, plan, and manage SOA projects that deliver value to both their immediate project and to the enterprise.\n\nThe Service-Oriented Architecture Course is structured in three parts: Understanding SOA, Designing SOA and Case Studies.\nPart I: Understanding SOA provides the motivation for SOA and the architectural requirements needed to meet them, then describes SOA architecture structure and principles, and finally describes the process for getting started with SOA in the enterprise.\nPart II: Designing SOA explores the details of each step in the design process. It is roughly divided into two main areas: \n1.    Topics Starting with the Business, Service Context and Common Semantics, Designing Service Interfaces, Designing Service Implementations cover the design of services \n2.    Topics Composing Services, Using Services to Build Enterprise Solutions, Designing and Using Integration in SOA Solutions, SOA Security, SOA Governance focus on building enterprise SOA solutions.\nPart III: Case Studies illustrate architecture and design principles and strategies by exploring two different case studies in depth. The first focuses on designing business services to support business processes.

Meets for one-half semester and yields half-course credit. \n\nPrepares students to apply the theories and research methods in health economics in order to analyze the challenging real world questions and to formulate health policies that would address the most pressing challenges. \nAs an example the course analyzes the trends of healthcare costs in industrialized nations and offers a set of theories and evidence on the root causes of the cost increase. It will also cover the interplay between insurance, technology, and demand for health care and hence the risk of similar cost inflation in developing countries. Based on the lessons learned from industrialized world a series of evidence based advices for formulation of cost containment policies will follow.  \nMajor abnormalities of health care market are discussed in this course. They improve the knowledge of students about the prevalent market failures and how to prevent or mitigate them. Additionally it will enhance studentsâ€™ knowledge in those areas that ordinary theories of microeconomics and health economics have not been able to provide convincing answers to real world phenomena.

What they met at the border, however, strays from our traditional conception of 1960s counterculture: the Hellâ€™s Angels Motorcycle Club, protesting their march as unpatriotic. How can we make sense of this standoff? Where do pro-country but anti-state cultural groups like the Hellâ€™s Angels fit within the rubric of political activism and counterculture in the 1960s? Was there a contemporaneous conservative counterculture, and what did it entail?\n\nIn this writing-intensive course, we will look beyond the conventional narrative of liberalism, political activism, and youth counterculture in the 1960s, toward the less-reconciled, more conservative, libertarian groups that also captured the era, including biker gangs, commune participants, and religious hippies. What were these groupsâ€™ social, ideological, and political views and motives? How does incorporating these groups into our conception of 1960â€™s â€œcountercultureâ€ alter our understanding of the movement and its origins? We will begin by reading expressions of the nature and purpose of such groups by members themselves, including sections of Sonny Bargerâ€™s autobiography. Then, employing contemporary definitions of counterculture and conservatism, alongside subcultural theory, students will interrogate whether these groups rightfully align with either concept.

These ideas inevitably shape behaviors and practices of people across time and cultures. Through music, people have expressed attitudes toward death that are in some respects universal, while in others personally and culturally specific. In this course, we will explore several works in the Classical tradition that influenced by the idea of death and dying, or honor the memories of the dead. In the first unit, we will listen to the multitude of representations of death in Liszt's Totentanz and other artistic representations of death, and discuss what it is about death that fascinated and inspired so many artists throughout time. In the second unit, we dissect Nagel's article Death and apply it to scene 4 of Ligeti's opera Le Grand Macabre, where we decipher who is 'dead', and who really died. In the final unit, we take a step back from death to look at requiems, ceremonial rites and other responses to death, and discuss how these responses to death are really a celebration of life and living.

The creation of this new nation â€“ dedicated to the promise of individual liberty and republican equality represented the culmination of a true revolutionary movement in America.\n\nIn this course, we will challenge this triumphalist definition of the American Revolution through the eyes of those frequently missing from the traditional historical narrative. We will examine the writings of women, slaves, soldiers, and loyalists to interrogate the causes, course, and consequences of the Revolution in the lives of our subjects. We will use these sources to paint a broad picture of the Revolution outside the government centers of London and Philadelphia and focus instead on life in the small towns, army encampments, and wild frontiers of North America. By the end of the course, we will develop a better understanding of the Revolution not as a single event characterizable in black-and-white terms but as a complicated historical process with multiple meanings to multiple individuals.

How did Evangelical Christians become Israel's best friend? We will seek to explore that question by looking at a few pieces of vital historical context. From the writings and speeches of key figures from John Nelson Darby to the modern Christian Zionist Evangelical pastor, John Hagee, we will trace central themes and ideas in the story of Evangelicalism and its relation to Jews and Israel. This will include an examination of how those ideas have been both challenged and championed and how they have persisted and adapted with the radical changes that occurred in both Christian and Jewish life in the 20th century.

What better way, therefore, for a biblical prophet to mock Assyrian power than to claim that even the trees will rejoice when Assyria's king is cut down instead?  In this course, we use modern metaphor theory and critical methods of biblical studies to examine a variety of prophetic oracles against \"enemies.\"  We discuss such questions as:  Who is the enemy?  How is the enemy portrayed?  How does the prophet use metaphor to enhance his message?   What do the biblical texts teach us about the history, politics, and perceptions that shaped the prophet's thinking?  The course will begin with a study of metaphorical oracles against Israel's enemies through a close reading of a specific biblical text (from Isaiah, Jeremiah, or Ezekiel).  For the lens essay, we will study the propagandistic aspect of enemy depictions, looking at the ways in which the prophets use ridicule, caricature, and demonization.  Finally, the research paper will allow you to explore an \"enemy oracle\" topic of your choice.\nThe primary goal of a University Writing Seminar is to prepare students for college-level academic writing.

What made urbanization possible?  What were the accomplishments of cities?  What were some of the problems?  Although cities were entering a new, modern era, not everything about them about them was positive.  Urban areas featured the most lavish Vanderbilt mansions and the most dirty, overcrowded tenementsâ€”often inhabited by immigrantsâ€”that could double as sweatshops.  Cities were centers of cutting edge social and political reforms as well as of race, gender, and class oppression.\nModern Metropolis will use New York and Chicago as subjects of inquiry. For the close reading assignment, you will examine the Chicago Vice Commission Report and consider the social and cultural themes the report addresses.  The lens essay assignment asks you to analyze photographs of New York by Jacob Riis and to consider photography as a tool for social change through the ideas of theorist Bruno Latour.  For your research paper, you will have the opportunity to research an aspect of turn-of-the-century urban life in depth and consider the historical trends at work.  In addition to working with these primary sources, we will also read secondary sources in order to gain insights into these centers of commerce and culture, such as selections from George Chaunceyâ€™s Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890-1940 and Mary Ting Yi Luiâ€™s The Chinatown Trunk Mystery: Murder, Miscegenation, and Other Dangerous Encounters.
