A popular, double-height cyber café, known as The World Court, is a dramatic space at the heart of the building, lit from floor-to-ceiling by windows overlooking wetlands and a wooded hillside. Built as an expansion to an existing circa 1972 building, the new academic complex nearly doubles the size of the school’s facilities. The program creates multiple overlapping points of activity throughout the building to stimulate interaction between students both academically and socially.
